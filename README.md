# ScoreCount App 
Two team score counters are used, with two activities and both explicit and implicit purposes. In this program, the user utilizes two buttons to start at 0 and increment the points of two teams. When a team reaches a score of 5, the "game" is over and that team is declared the winner. A second activity is initiated, which determines the winner as well as evaluates and reports the game's score spread. A button on the second action launches a third activity in which the user may share their triumph with a buddy by entering their phone number. This activity has three buttons: the first dials the phone number entered, the second sends a message stating the winner and the score spread, and the third looks for basketball in the user's location.
